# Remote-Execution-of-Command
This program is written in Python 2
This program is all about Remotely Executing the commands on Client side from shell. This can be useful for helping purposes like you can solve the problem of your friend remotely through shell. and it can also be used for "Cyber-Security Purpose". So plz you this do not misuse this program,

# GUIDE TO EFFECTIVELY USE THIS PROGRAM.

1) First of all change the IP according to you need.Like In CMReverse.py program put your machine IP address and IN Server.py put the Ip adress of machine 
   you want to connect with or You can give Port Forword IP in order to perform attack on you entire router network.
2) First of all change the CMReverse.py to executable file.But Just Clinet file not Server file because you will keep Server.py in your PC.
3) Then send or give that executable file to the target or victim .And ask them to click on that file only once.
4) And then enjoy using your Victim Machine. 

The Good thing is that if in case victim close the program from task-bar even though it will keep running On your side.But victim can see that you are using his machine
because I have made this program for helping purposes. But if you want to anonymously use the victim's machine without their permission or Knowledge.
